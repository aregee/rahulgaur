Book Review: Siddhartha

Introduction and Disclaimer

I'm having a hard time coming up with something to write about. I'm starting to think that I'm a pretty boring guy. So I've decided to write about books. I guess I *am* a pretty boring guy after all. Oh well. 

I've only started reading books everyday a few months ago. I've read books when I was younger, but most of them were school requirements. But that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy them. In fact, looking back, I loved books then as much as I do now. It's only just recently that I could afford to buy my own books. 

This probably won't be much of a review as much as it is praise for the book. I am by no means a literary expert. I'm probably not a literary anything. I'm just some guy who loves books (with a huge bias towards their covers).

The "Review" Proper

Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is one of the first books I bought a few months ago together with The Prince, which has remained unread to this day.
