{% excerpt %}
{% markdown %}
With the `sp_makewebtask` stored procedure, you can easily generate Excel spreadsheet files with T-SQL. `sp_makewebtask` actually generates an HTML file but since Excel can read HTML tables with no problems, specifying ".xls" for the output filename extension gives you a nice Excel spreadsheet.
{% endmarkdown %}

Admittedly, it is a bit limited in function, but when you just need a quick way to generate a decently formatted Excel spreadsheet, then `sp_makewebtask` is a good choice.
